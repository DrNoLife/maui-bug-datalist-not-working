Bug report regarding the &lt;datalist> element in MAUI Blazor 

# The problem

The ```datalist``` element, no longer works as it should do, when using MauiHybrid (Maui with Blazor).

The element works exactly as it should in Blazor WASM.

When trying to use the element in MauiHybrid, the suggestions-box is not appearing. Neither when clicking on the input field, nor when typing.
